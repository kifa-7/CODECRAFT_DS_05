# Task 05 - Traffic Accident Pattern Analysis (Pure Python)

## 📌 Objective

Analyze traffic accident data to identify key patterns related to:
- 🌧️ Weather
- 🛣️ Road Conditions
- 🕒 Time of Day

Also, visualize hotspots and contributing factors using **only core Python** — no external libraries or files.

## 📁 Dataset

Original Reference:  
🔗 [US Accident EDA – Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/harshalbhamare/us-accident-eda)

> ⚠️ This project simulates a small sample of accident data **directly in Python code** (no CSV or libraries used).

---

## 🧪 Implementation

This program:
- Simulates accident records (10 entries)
- Counts:
  - Accidents by **weather condition**
  - Accidents by **road condition**
  - Accidents by **time of day**
- Uses simple `print()`-based **bar graphs** to visualize the data
